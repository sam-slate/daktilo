This project was me playing around with chains of two word phrases. There are a couple different games and puzzles built on top of a dictionary of two word phrases. 

The github link is [here][github-link], and it includes the code and descriptions of the files and how to set them up and play!

## Project Reflection

I wanted something fun to do with python, and I had always been fascinated with word games and the ability of a computer to play a user. Basically I wanted to play these games and I had no one to play with :) 

The most fun part of this for me was building out the dictionary of two-word phrases, then designing a program that would "learn" more two-word phrases as it played against you. It would add these phrases to its memory and then use them against you later on in the game. This fascinates me because it's a way of a computer collecting information and improving itself based off interacting with humans.

I also got to play around a lot with JSON and classes in Python (which are frustratingly different than C++ classes) and expand my Python skills while I expanded my disenchantment with C++.
