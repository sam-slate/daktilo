This is a C++ Pointer Interpreter and Simulation built in the Khan Academy coding environment using JavaScript and ProcessingJS. The simulation can be found on Khan Academy [here][khan-link] and on GitHub [here][github-link].

You can also play around with the embedded version below, although you must scroll left first to get the full simulation into view.

## Project Reflection

I made this project to send in with an internship application for Khan Academy, but by the time I had finished the application was closed! I had a ton of fun making it however :) I was basically learning the Khan Academy coding environment, JavaScript, and ProcessingJS as I was going along, so parts of the code will probably look prettier than other parts.

I was motivated to make this project based on all the times I've been talking with students and felt everything would be easier if I just had an interactive visualization of pointers. I wanted the basic image of memory and I wanted the user to be able to input code. 

I started on this right after I had finished up my course on programming languages, and I was super into the idea of building a simple compiler of C++ in JavaScript. Big mistake. I ended up building a super hacky tree of functions that is able to interpret (and write error messages) for simple C++ statements, but it took a lot of frustration and energy to get there. Seeing the final code handle errors and execute successfully though is a great feeling :)

I'm sure someone who has any experience in data visualization would cringe at my code but I'm proud of this!
