 I was born in Chicago IL, raised in [West Hartford CT](https://connecticuthistory.org/the-debate-over-who-could-occupy-world-war-ii-public-housing-in-west-hartford/), and now split my time between my family's home in Cambridge MA and the food and justice based [coop](https://www.facebook.com/TuftsCraftsHouse/) I live in on Tufts campus. 

I see my life as a mix of a lot of things, including:

<table style="width:100%" font>
  <tr>
    <td>~ cooking</td>
    <td>~ swimming</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>~ coding</td>
    <td>~ talking about feelings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>~ organizing</td> 
    <td>~ hugging people and/or dogs</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>~ writing music</td> 
    <td>~ being Jewish</td>  
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>~ making bad puns</td>
    <td>~ sleeping</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>~ living cooperatively</td>
    <td>~ watching college a capella videos</td>
  </tr>

</table> 

If you see me, odds are I'm doing one of these things or actively wishing I was!
