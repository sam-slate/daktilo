# No Pressure Text Expectations

If you are here, that means that you received a text that ended with a link to this page. Someone is checking in on you but doesn’t want to add to your current burdens. They would like to set these four expectations:

1. You are in no way expected to reply to this text in any capacity. 
2. If you do reply to this text, you do not have to do so in a timely manner.
3. If you reply to this text in an “untimely manner”, you are not expected to apologize or explain why.
4. If any of this happens, the sender will not hold judgment or think less of you.

Hopefully, these expectations will help you feel loved and not burdened!
